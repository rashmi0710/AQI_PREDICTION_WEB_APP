# AQI_Prediction
In this project i have created a web app using flask for  predicting Air Quality Index using Machine learning. i have collected the data from Central Pollution Control Board which is a government website which records the data of all the cities of india. But i have collected data of three cities only and performed data cleaning, data processing, and handling null and outliers after that i have used scikit learn library for multiple linear regression model which train the model for predicting AQI values based on the parameters. Using Flask fully end to end web app has been made.
